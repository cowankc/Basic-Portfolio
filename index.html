            My name is Kevin Cowan and I am an aspiring Web Developer! I am self 
        taught and started learning on my own at the end of 2018. I enjoy web 
        development because I get to create projects and problem solve. I also enjoy 
        the feeling of accomplishment I get after writing my own code and seeing it 
        work perfectly, or fixing code that needed to be debugged and seeing it work
        correctly. Besides practicing my coding skills I also like to play video games. 
        I usually play on cosoles, either PS4 or the Switch, but will also play some PC 
        games occasionally (I always find my way back to playing Minecraft). I am also 
        a movie nerd and love watching Marvel movies or anything made by Scorsese! 
            I have lived in Austin since 2016 but I actually grew up in Derry New 
        Hampshire, which is about 45 minutes north of Boston. As much as I miss Skiing on
        the White Mountains, Austin has been a great home for the past few years! I would 
        say the best part about living here is the laid back feeling of the city and how 
        friendly the people are. Breakfast tacos are also a big plus, not much offerings in 
        the taco game up North.
